            <h2>Black Lives Matter (BLM)</h2>
            <p>An organization known simply as Black Lives Matter exists as a decentralized network with about 16
                chapters in the United States and Canada, while a larger Black Lives Matter movement exists consisting
                of various separate like-minded organizations such as Dream Defenders and Assata's Daughters. The
                broader movement and its related organizations typically advocate against police violence towards black
                people, as well as for various other policy changes considered to be related to black liberation.</p>

            <h2>Police Brutality</h2>
            <p>The term "police brutality" was first used in Britain in the mid-19th century, with The Puppet-Show (a
                short-lived rival to Punch) complaining in September 1848:

                Scarcely a week passes without their committing some offence which disgusts everybody but the
                magistrates. Boys are bruised by their ferocity, women insulted by their ruffianism; and that which
                brutality has done, perjury denies, and magisterial stupidity suffers to go unpunished. [...] And
                "police brutality" is fast becoming one of our most "venerated institutions!"</p>
